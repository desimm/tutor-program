#Briefing
 This example is only one HTML5 file called index.html and a folder called assets that stores one image. Dont worry
 about any more files or folders you may see. This  example uses ONLY HTML no other language. HTML is the *structure* of a
 web page. Every web page must use some form of HTML in order for a browser to render or understand what to display. Also
 search engines like Google or if you were to write your own web crawler will have to use the HTML of your website to understand
 what your website is about and how it is built. IF I were to compare this to construction HTML is the foundation and wood beams
 that hold your house together, without the frame or structure you could not add other things to the house or web page. For instance
 if you want the background of your website to be black instead of white, you can write CSS which is a language used to *style*
 <body> tag of the HTML. Since the <body> tag is the "parent" meaning all the other HTML is inside it, you can think of it
 as it is the background to the webpage.
